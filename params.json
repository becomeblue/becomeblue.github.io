But we do not have an instruction that can get him over it. In programming you can write new programs to do things. What we need is more control over Robo.\r\n\r\n> Go `update robo-lang`\r\n\r\n    $\r\n    Updating robo-lang to version 3.0\r\n    Update complete!\r\n\r\nRobo Language 3.0 looks like this:\r\n\r\n    // Importing Robo Language 3.0 function which jumps Robo over one space\r\n    import legs.jump\r\n\r\n    jump() :           // New jump function\r\n      legs.jump()\r\n\r\n    jump()             // Using jump function\r\n    step(2)\r\n    turn(90)\r\n\r\n> Go write a program, upload and then run it.\r\n\r\n\t// Write move.bot here\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    //\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n    $\r\n    Uploading program move.bot to Flash Memory\r\n\r\n    $\r\n    Reading program move.bot from Flash Memory\r\n    Running program move.bot\r\n\r\nRobo was taking awhile to process our new instructions. It is time we upgraded his hardware.\r\n\r\n![Inside Robo](file:///E:/aaron/Documents/My%20Documents/COMPSCI%20101/Images/head.png \"Inside Robo\")\r\n\r\nInside Robo's head is the CPU that reads and runs our program and the flash memory where we are storing our program. As a program gets bigger more and more instructions are being read from our program. We are using flash memory to store our program but this can be slow to read from. A type of fast memory is called RAM. RAM is fast to read and write to but when the power goes off everything is erased.\r\n\r\nWe will store our program in flash memory, when we run our program the CPU will copy the program from flash memory to RAM, and then the CPU will read our instructions faster from RAM. Let's install some RAM.\r\n\r\n> Go write RAM in the empty part\r\n\r\n![RAM](file:///E:/aaron/Documents/My%20Documents/COMPSCI%20101/Images/ram.png \"Install RAM\")\r\n\r\n> Go `check hardware`\r\n\r\n    $\r\n    Checking hardware...\r\n    CPU installed\r\n    Flash Memory installed\r\n    RAM installed\r\n    Everything is OK!\r\n\r\n> Go run the program again.\r\n\r\n    $\r\n    Copying program move.bot from Flash Memory to RAM\r\n    Reading program move.bot from RAM\r\n    Running program move.bot\r\n\r\nWe are ready to begin COMPSCI 101 and learn to...\r\n\r\n![hacker](file:///E:/aaron/Documents/My%20Documents/COMPSCI%20101/Images/hacker.png \"Hacker\")\r\n\r\nWait a minute somebody is hacking into Robo!\r\n\r\nTo stop somebody else programming Robo we need security.\r\n\r\n> Go `set password`\r\n\r\n    $\r\n    Enter Password:\r\n    Confirm Password:\r\n    Password Set!\r\n\r\n![hacker_no](file:///E:/aaron/Documents/My%20Documents/COMPSCI%20101/Images/hacker_no.png \"Hacker Stopped\")\r\n\r\nTake that hacker!\r\n\r\nGood, now we have had a taste of what this course is all about.
