<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compscinz/compscinz.github.io/master/images/hardware/hardware-desktop.png"></p>

<p>A <code>desktop</code> is a computer that stays in one place, plugs into the wall and has a wired connection. You plug in a screen, keyboard and mouse. Inside a desktop is a motherboard, hard drive, disc drive, and power supply. A motherboard is a circuit board where you will find the CPU, RAM, ROM and connectors to the ports. Common ports found on a desktop: USB, video, audio, ethernet and power.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compscinz/compscinz.github.io/master/images/hardware/hardware-laptop.png"></p>

<p>A <code>laptop</code> is a movable computer, with a battery, that connects wirelessly. It will have a screen, keyboard and trackpad built into it. Inside a laptop is a motherboard (CPU, RAM, ROM, WiFi module), hard drive, and battery. An external power supply is used with a laptop. A laptop also comes with a camera, microphone, and speakers. Common ports found on a laptop: USB, video, audio, memory card slot and power.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compscinz/compscinz.github.io/master/images/hardware/hardware-smartphone.png"></p>

<p>A <code>smartphone</code> is a hand-held computer, with a battery, that connects to mobile networks. Inside a smartphone is a circuit board containing a CPU/GPU, RAM, flash memory, GSM module, WiFi module and sim card slot. A smartphone also comes with a camera, microphone, speaker, and battery. Common ports found on a smartphone: audio, memory card slot, and USB.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compscinz/compscinz.github.io/master/images/hardware/hardware-pi.png"></p>

<p>A <code>Raspberry Pi</code> is a computer on a single board, the size of a credit card. You can plug in a screen, keyboard and mouse. On the board is a System on a Chip (CPU, GPU, RAM), memory card slot, input/output pins, and ports for USB, ethernet, video, audio and power. An external power supply is used with a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compscinz/compscinz.github.io/master/images/hardware/hardware-beaglebone.png"></p>

<p>A <code>BeagleBone Black</code> is a computer on a single board. You can plug in a screen, keyboard and mouse, however a BeagleBone Black is made to be plugged directly into your desktop or laptop via USB. On the board is a CPU, RAM, flash memory, input/output headers, and ports for USB, ethernet, video/audio, and power.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compscinz/compscinz.github.io/master/images/hardware/hardware-arduino.png"></p>

<p>An <code>Arduino</code> is a microcontroller board. A microcontroller is a computer on a single chip. On the board is a microcontroller (CPU, RAM, ROM, flash memory), crystal oscillator, input/output pins, and ports for USB and power. An Arduino is powered over USB or with an external power supply.</p>

<!--Computer Parts-->
<h3><a id="parts" class="anchor" href="#parts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Computer Parts</h3>

<p>The most important parts in a computer system are as follows:</p>

<p>A <code>central processing unit (CPU)</code> is hardware that reads computer programs from memory and carries out the instructions. The CPU controls everything in the system.</p>

<p><code>Random-access memory (RAM)</code> is a type of fast working memory, where all of the information is lost when powered is removed.</p>

<p><code>Read-only memory (ROM)</code> is permanent memory used to store computer programs that are not to be changed, like the BIOS.</p>

<p><code>Flash memory</code> or <code>hard drives</code> are types of slow memory that are used to store information after power is removed.</p>

<p>A <code>disc drive</code> is used to read and write to optical media such as CDs and DVDs.</p>

<p>A <code>power supply</code> converts power from the source and feeds power around the system.</p>

<p>Other common parts and terms to know are as follows:</p>

<p><code>GPU</code> stands for graphics processing unit.</p>

<p><code>USB</code> stands for Universal Serial Bus.</p>

<p>An <code>SD card</code> is a type of flash memory.</p>

<p><code>Ethernet</code> is wired connectivity.</p>

<p><code>WiFi</code> is wireless connectivity.</p>

<p><code>GSM</code> stands for Global System for Mobile Communications.</p>

<p>A <code>sim card</code> is an integrated circuit used to connect to a mobile network.</p>

<p><code>GPIO</code> stands for General Purpose Input/Output.</p>

<p><code>HDMI</code> is a connection for video and audio.</p>

<p>A <code>crystal oscillator</code> is an electronic circuit that uses a vibrating crystal to create a signal with a precise frequency.</p>
