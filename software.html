<!--Software-->
<h2><a id="software" class="anchor" href="#software" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software</h2>

<p>A computer has stuff that tells it what to do, and is all the stuff we see on our screen, or don't see. <code>Software</code> is a set of instructions that tells a computer's processor to do certain things.</p>

<!--Operating Systems-->
<h3><a id="systems" class="anchor" href="#systems" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Operating Systems</h3>

<p>An <code>operating system (OS)</code> is software that manages hardware, other programs, and users. An OS is the foundation for everything a common user wants to do with their computer, and is one of the most, if not the most, important piece of software.</p>

<p>Common operating systems are Windows, OS X, Linux and BSD.</p>

<!--Application Software-->
<h3><a id="apps" class="anchor" href="#apps" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software Applications</h3>

<p><code>Software applications</code> are computer programs designed to let the user do stuff on their computers. Common software applications include web browsers, file managers, word processors, media players, and games. Applications (or Apps) need an operating system to manage the hardware and perform tasks that the application needs, like run the code or display graphics on a screen.</p>

<p>A <code>web browser</code> is a software application used to retrieve information, present information like web pages, images, and videos, and to send information. Information could be retrieved from files on your computer, over a local network, or via the internet.</p>

<p>A simple example of what a browser does is what might happen after you enter a web address. The browser may retrieve an HTML file associated with that web address, read the HTML code which gives instructions for what the web page will look like, and then the browser will display that web page.</p>

<p>A <code>file manager</code> is a graphical interface to our files and folders. We can navigate around our filesystem, manage our files and folders by creating, deleting, and renaming them, and open files with other software applications.</p>

<p><code>Word processors</code> are used to write, edit and format documents. We can save the documents as different file types on our computer, or send the files to our printer to be printed.</p>

<p><code>Media players</code> could be made to play audio or video. They are used to open audio or video files on our computer, and need more resources and access to hardware, like graphics processors and sound cards, than other applications might.</p>

<p><code>Computer games</code> are pieces of software that are made to be interacted with by a user on their computer. This often involves a player, controlling a character, trying to pass levels. Games can have stories, graphics, sound effects and music, and can be multiplayer.</p>
