<p>We are going to be <b>thinking like a computer</b>. That is more of what we have been doing so far with Robo Language 1.0 and also looking at binary 1010 0110, no it is not the Matrix but how computers understand.</p>
<p>We are going to be taking a <b>look inside computers</b>. That is adding to our list of hardware: CPU, flash memory, RAM, hard drive, disk drive, power supply and more.</p>
<p>We are going to be <b>using any computer</b> in front of us. That is navigating an operating system, learning how to use our software, understanding the magic behind files and getting down and dirty with the command line.</p>
<p>We are going to be <b>programming</b>. First learning the basics with Robo Language 2.0 and then delving into the programming languages of games, the web, and electronics - we will do it all while coding our own calculator, games, website and by blinking some LEDs.</p>
<p>e are going to be taking our <b>security and privacy</b> seriously. That is creating strong passwords, deciding what information to share online and looking at the realities of the internet.</p>
<p>Finally we will discuss <b>copyright and ethics</b> in computing and decide on the kind of world we want to live and code in.</p>
<p>Good, now we have an idea of what is to come in this course. Let's move on and start <a href="http://www.compsci.nz/ch3"><b>thinking like a computer</b></a>.</p>
