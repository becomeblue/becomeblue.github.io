<p>[robo]()</p>

<p>Here is Robo, maybe we will build him one day.</p>

<p>[robo_cpu_flash]()</p>

<p>He has a central processing unit somewhere inside his head that reads computer programs and runs them, and some flash memory where all of the computer programs are stored.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go check his hardware by pressing the button</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>Check<br>Hardware

<pre><code>Checking hardware...
CPU installed
Flash Memory installed
Everything is OK!
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>A central processing unit has something to do with (tick a box):</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] running programs</li>
<li>[ ] storing programs</li>
<li>[ ] eating programs</li>
</ul>

<p>Flash memory has something to do with:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] running programs</li>
<li>[ ] watching programs</li>
<li>[ ] storing programs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>[speech_move]()</p>

<p>He doesn't understand the language we speak, he only understands Robo Language 1.0, which is installed in the flash memory.</p>

<p>Robo Language 1.0 looks like this:</p>

<p>[lang1.0]()</p>

<p>Let's program Robo to move somewhere.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>[level]()</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go write a move.bot program, upload it to Robo and then run it.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>// Anything after two slashes is a comment that tells us stuff
// Comments are not part of the program
// Write move.bot below






//
</code></pre>

<p></p>Upload

<pre><code>Uploading program move.bot to Flash Memory
</code></pre>

<p></p>Run

<pre><code>Reading program move.bot from Flash Memory
Running program move.bot
</code></pre>

<p>Usually programs are typed on computers with keyboards and usually programming languages are made up of those keyboard characters.</p>

<p>Let's update our software to Robo Language 2.0 using the terminal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go write <code>update robo-lang</code> after the <code>$</code></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>$
Updating robo-lang to version 2.0
Update complete!
</code></pre>

<p>Robo Language 2.0 looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>step 2      // step forward two spaces, you can choose any number
turn right      // turn right 90 degrees, you can choose left also
</code></pre>

<p>Let's program Robo to get back to the start.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go write a program, <code>upload move.bot</code> and then <code>run move.bot</code></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>// Write move.bot here






//
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<pre><code>$
Uploading program move.bot to Flash Memory

$
Reading program move.bot from Flash Memory
Running program move.bot
</code></pre>

<p>Let's get ready for the next course.</p>

<p>[level_crack]()</p>

<p>A big crack has appeared in Robo's path! But we do not have an instruction that can get him over it. In programming you can write new programs to do things. What we need is more control over Robo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go <code>update robo-lang</code></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>$
Updating robo-lang to version 3.0
Update complete!
</code></pre>

<p>Robo Language 3.0 looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Importing Robo Language 3.0 function which jumps Robo over one space
import legs.jump

jump() :           // New jump function
  legs.jump()

jump()             // Using jump function
step(2)
turn(90)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Go write a program, upload and then run it.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>// Write move.bot here






//
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<pre><code>$
Uploading program move.bot to Flash Memory

$
Reading program move.bot from Flash Memory
Running program move.bot
</code></pre>

<p>Robo was taking awhile to process our new instructions. It is time we upgraded his hardware.</p>

<p>[robo_cpu_flash]()</p>

<p>Inside Robo's head is the CPU that reads and runs our program and the flash memory where we are storing our program. As a program gets bigger more and more instructions are being read from our program. We are using flash memory to store our program but this can be slow to read from. A type of fast memory is called RAM. RAM is fast to read and write to but when the power goes off everything is erased.</p>

<p>We will store our program in flash memory, when we run our program the CPU will copy the program from flash memory to RAM, and then the CPU will read our instructions faster from RAM. Let's install some RAM.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go write RAM in the empty part</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[robo_ram]()</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go <code>check hardware</code></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>$
Checking hardware...
CPU installed
Flash Memory installed
RAM installed
Everything is OK!
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Go run the program again.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>$
Copying program move.bot from Flash Memory to RAM
Reading program move.bot from RAM
Running program move.bot
</code></pre>

<p>We are ready to begin COMPSCI 101 and learn to...</p>

<p>[hacker]()</p>

<p>Wait a minute somebody is hacking into Robo!</p>

<p>To stop somebody else programming Robo we need security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go <code>set password</code></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>$
Enter Password:
Confirm Password:
Password Set!
</code></pre>

<p>[hacker_denied]()</p>

<p>Take that hacker!</p>

<p>Good, now we have had a taste of what this course is all about. Let's move on.</p>
